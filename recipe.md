# Chocolate Truffule Cake - Recipe
### Step 1 : Prepare a chocolate mix and preheat the oven
###### Take a saucepan and add chopped cooking chocolate and 1/2 cup butter and cook it over low heat until both these ingredients melt and form a smooth paste. Remove from heat and keep aside for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, butter up your cake tin and preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celcius for 5 minutes. 
###### Remember: If you have more than one tins, you can grease all of them to make a layered cake, otherwise, you can also bake one cake and then cut it into layers.
###	Step 2 : Combine the wet and dry ingredients
###### Take another large bowl and add eggs along with sugar and vanilla extract to it. Beat it until smooth and then add in the chocolate mixture. Beat it again until smooth. In a different bowl, combine the dry ingredients such as flour, sugar and baking soda. Mix them well and add to the chocolate mixture. Mix it with light strokes and combine everything well.
### Step 3 : Put the cake to bake and prepare the filling
###### Add this batter to all the cake tins or the single cake tin and bake for 30 minutes. To prepare the filling, take a saucepan and add the rest of the cooking chocolate with butter. Add in the caster sugar and whipping cream and form a smooth mixture. For the chocolate ganache, heat the cream over medium flame and just when it is about to come to a boil, add it to cooking chocolate in a bowl and whisk rapidly until a smooth, luscious cream is formed.
###	Step 4 : Layer, decorate and serve!
###### Now that the cakes have cooled, take them out and let them cool on cooling racks for about 10 minutes. If you baked a single cake, keep a plate over the cake top and carefully slide a serrated knife through the cake, cutting an even-surfaced layer. Add the filling to each layer and top the top layer with ganache. Follow the same steps for layering if you have baked more than one cake. Grate some more cooking chocolate on the top and serve!
